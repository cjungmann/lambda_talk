# Lambda Talk

This repository contains several files I used to prepare for a
presentation on Lambda Expressions.

There are several subdirectories with source code.  Except for
`01_node`, which is javascript intenteded to run under node.js,
all the source files are C++.

To compile the source files, open in EMACS, type M-x compile.
EMACS will use the compile-command at the top of the file to
compile and create the executable.

There is a bookmark directory that will use EMACS to open
source files with the cursor at line numbers of interest for
the presentation.
